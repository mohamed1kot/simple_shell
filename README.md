# Simple Shell Project

This is the Simple Shell project, a challenging and highly anticipated endeavor that will test your understanding of:

- Basics of programming
- Basics of C
- Basics of thinking like an engineer
- Group work
- Learning how to learn

## Important Guidelines

### Framework Reminder

Make sure to be familiar with the project framework. If you haven't memorized it yet, review it [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559).

### Coding Ethics

- **No Code Copying:** It is strictly forbidden to look at or copy code from other people, whether they are fellow students or online sources. At ALX SE, copying solutions is not allowed.

- **Individual Coding:** After receiving help, always write the code alone from scratch to ensure comprehension. If you can't do it on your own, you need to study more.

### Collaboration and Pair Programming

This project is a group project, and you will be paired with a partner. It is essential to apply the lessons learned from previous collaborative experiences, such as the printf project.

A group project at ALX SE is a shared responsibility. All code pushed to GitHub is the joint responsibility of both partners. It is not acceptable to claim ignorance later if issues arise; communication is key.

### Plagiarism Policy

If a group is caught for plagiarism, both partners will face consequences. Ignorance or claiming not to have contributed will not excuse any individual from the consequences.

### Shell Project Specifics

The shell project is an exciting group endeavor. Enjoy the process and good luck!

## Resources

Read or watch:

- Unix shell
- Thompson shell
- Ken Thompson
- [Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64)

Refer to the man pages for:

- sh (Run sh as well)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General:**

- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / "end-of-file"?

**Copyright - Plagiarism:**

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself. Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

**General:**

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- The shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when necessary

**GitHub:**

- There should be one project repository per group. If both partners have a repository with the same name, a 0% score is risked. Add your partner as a collaborator.

## Usage

Compile your shell using the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
